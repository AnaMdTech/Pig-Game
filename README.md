# Pig Game ðŸŽ²

## Description

The Pig Game is a simple dice game played by two players. The objective of the game is to reach a score of 100 points before the opponent. The game is played with a single dice, and each player takes turns rolling the dice and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current turn's points and the other player takes their turn. The game features a user-friendly interface with visual feedback for active players and the current scores.

## Features

- **Hold**: Hold the current score and add it to the total score of the active player.
- **New Game**: Start a new game, resetting all scores and settings.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicate the active player and the winner.
